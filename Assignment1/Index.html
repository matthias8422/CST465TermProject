        <p>
            My idea is for a monthly or weekly food planning helper. This planner will allow you to pick from a list of meals for each day of the week or month.
            It will then show you exactly what ingredients you will need for all of those meals. It will then allow the printing of a shopping list. The meals themselves will be user submitted.
            They will fill out a form that allows any number of ingredients. It will require a name for the meal, a number of how many people it serves, a list of ingredients and lastly instructions on how to make said meal.
            The benifits of such a system are listed below. There will be at a minimum of two forms one for creating a new recipe and another for creating a meal plan.
            All the recipes will be stored on a server in a database.
        </p>

        <ul class="list-group">
            <li class="list-group-item">No more having to come up with a dinner plan on the spot</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">No more quick runs to the store because you forgot eggs or milk</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">It will help people eat helthier</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">It will allow people on a budget to know exaclty how much they will spend on food for any given month</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Laslty, it will allow a variety of meals to be used rather then someones favorite couple of meals thay make all the time</li>
        </ul>
